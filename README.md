# Algorithm Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive platform to visualize and understand various algorithms, including Tree, Graph, Searching, and Sorting algorithms.

## Features

- Visualize Tree Algorithms (BST, AVL, Red-Black Tree, Heap)
- Visualize Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, A*, DFS, BFS)
- Visualize Array Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Visualize Array Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort)
- Dark mode toggle for better accessibility
- Responsive sidebar navigation
- Feedback form

## Getting Started
